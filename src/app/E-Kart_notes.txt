      googlefonts- import link

4)Lazy-Loading
----------------
Lazy loading is a technology of angular that allows you to load JavaScript components 
when a specific route is activated. It improves application load time speed by splitting
 the application into many bundles. When the user navigates by the app, bundles are loaded as needed.

Lazy loading helps to keep the bundle size small, which helps reduce load times. 
We must use the class decorator to create an Angular module @NgModule, and the decorator 
uses a metadata object that defines the module.

5)creating new module in angular --here we create new module for implementing lazy loading

      ng g m products --route products --module app.module

6)components inside lazy loading (products module)
   
   ng g c products/allProducts
   ng g c products/viewProducts
   ng g c products/wishlist
   ng g c products/cart

7)components outside lazy loading
   ng g c header
   ng g c footer
   ng g c pagenotfound

8)setup path
  localhost/4200---/allproducts

9)set up services inside products module
      ng g s products/services/api
